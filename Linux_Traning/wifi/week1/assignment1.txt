Question 1: In which OSI layer does the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fit?
Physical Layer (Layer 1): This layer handles the actual transmission of radio signals over the air. Wi-Fi uses different frequency bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) and modulation techniques to send data wirelessly.
and Data Link Layer (Layer 2): This layer is responsible for data framing, MAC (Media Access Control) addressing, and ensuring reliable communication between devices. The IEEE 802.11 standard defines how Wi-Fi devices communicate at this layer.

Question 2: Can you share the Wi-Fi devices that you are using day to day life, share that device's wireless capability/properties after connecting to network. Match your device to corresponding Wi-Fi Generations based on properties

Question 3: What is BSS and ESS?
Basic Service Set (BSS):
BSS is the fundamental building block of a Wi-Fi network. It consists of a single access point (AP) and the devices (stations) connected to it.
Extended Service Set (ESS):
ESS consists of multiple interconnected BSSs to form a larger network.

Question 4: What are the basic functionalities of a Wi-Fi Access Point?
A WAP is a device that allows you to connect wirelessly to a network, such as the internet or a local area network (LAN). It acts as a central hub for wireless communication and enables devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to access the network without the need for wired connections.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5: Difference between Bridge Mode and Repeater Mode

Bridge Mode

Connects two separate networks and allows communication between them.

Used to extend wired network connections wirelessly.

Devices connected in bridge mode usually belong to different network segments.

Example: A Wi-Fi bridge connects a wired office network to a wireless building network.

Repeater Mode

Extends the range of an existing Wi-Fi network by amplifying and retransmitting the signal.

Keeps the same network segment and does not create a new network.

Ideal for eliminating dead zones in large homes or buildings.

Example: A Wi-Fi repeater placed between a router and a weak signal area boosts connectivity.

Question 6: What are the differences between 802.11a and 802.11b?

802.11a

Frequency: 5 GHz band

Speed: Up to 54 Mbps

Range: Shorter due to higher frequency

Interference: Less interference since the 5 GHz band is less crowded

Use Case: Suitable for high-speed applications in environments with minimal obstructions

802.11b

Frequency: 2.4 GHz band

Speed: Up to 11 Mbps

Range: Longer due to better penetration through walls

Interference: More interference from common devices like microwaves and Bluetooth

Use Case: Suitable for basic web browsing and email in larger areas

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7: What is the difference between WPA and WPA2?

WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)

Introduced as a temporary replacement for WEP security.

Uses TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) for encryption.

Vulnerabilities: Susceptible to some security flaws, though stronger than WEP.

Introduced in: 2003.

WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)

Successor to WPA with improved security.

Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for stronger encryption.

More resistant to hacking attempts compared to WPA.

Introduced in: 2004.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ad hoc Network

An Ad hoc network is a decentralized wireless network where devices communicate directly with each other without requiring a central access point (AP) or infrastructure.

Uses peer-to-peer (P2P) communication.

Typically implemented using the IEEE 802.11 IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set).

Advantages of Ad hoc Networks

No Infrastructure Required – Does not rely on routers or access points.

Easy and Quick Setup – Ideal for temporary or emergency networks.

Cost-Effective – No need for additional network hardware.

Flexible and Scalable – Can be established anywhere with available devices.

Useful in Remote Areas – Can be deployed in disaster zones, military operations, or fieldwork.

Disadvantages of Ad hoc Networks

Limited Range – Devices must be within a short distance of each other.

Security Risks – Lack of central control makes it vulnerable to attacks.

Interference Issues – Unregulated communication can lead to signal disruptions.

Lower Performance – May suffer from latency and lower speeds due to decentralized management.

Difficult to Manage – No centralized control makes troubleshooting complex.

Question 9: What is CSMA/CA?

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)

CSMA/CA is a network protocol used in wireless communication (Wi-Fi) to reduce the chances of data collisions by avoiding simultaneous transmissions. It is a fundamental part of IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi networks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 10: What is SSID?

Service Set Identifier (SSID)

SSID is the unique name assigned to a Wi-Fi network to distinguish it from others.
