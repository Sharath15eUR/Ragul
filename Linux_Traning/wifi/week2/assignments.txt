1. Brief about SplitMAC architecture and how it improves the AP's performance

    SplitMAC architecture divides MAC layer functionalities between the Access Point (AP) and Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).

    The AP handles real-time functions like encryption and decryption.

    The WLC manages control and policy enforcement.

This reduces the processing burden on APs and centralizes network management, improving performance and scalability.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Describe CAPWAP, explain the flow between AP and Controller

    CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a tunneling protocol that allows lightweight APs to communicate with a central controller.
    CAPWAP Flow:

    Discovery: AP searches for a WLC.

    Join: AP establishes a connection with the WLC.

    Configuration: WLC provisions the AP with necessary settings.

    Data Forwarding: AP forwards client data to WLC over the CAPWAP tunnel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Where does CAPWAP fit in the OSI model, and what are the two tunnels in CAPWAP and their purpose?

    CAPWAP operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model.

    It establishes two tunnels:

        Control Tunnel → For AP-WLC communication, configuration, and management.

        Data Tunnel → For forwarding client data between AP and WLC.

4. Difference between Lightweight APs and Cloud-based APs
        Feature	Lightweight APs	Cloud-based APs
        Management	Requires an on-premises WLC	Managed through a cloud controller
        Configuration	WLC pushes policies and updates	Centralized via cloud
        Traffic Flow	Routes through WLC	Traffic can go directly to the internet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. How is the CAPWAP tunnel maintained between AP and controller?

    The tunnel is maintained using keepalive messages.

    If the AP fails to receive responses, it re-initiates the discovery process to connect with the WLC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Difference between Sniffer and Monitor mode, with use cases

    Mode	Function	Use Case
    Sniffer Mode	AP captures and forwards wireless traffic to a packet analyzer (e.g., Wireshark)	Troubleshooting and debugging network issues
    Monitor Mode	AP scans all channels to detect interference, rogue APs, or security threats	Security analysis and performance optimization

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. If WLC is deployed in WAN, which AP mode is best for the local network and why?

    Best Mode: FlexConnect Mode (Hybrid Mode)

    Why?

        Allows local authentication and traffic forwarding.

        Reduces latency and dependence on WLC when WAN connectivity is lost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Challenges of deploying more than 50 autonomous APs in a large network like a university

    Configuration Complexity – Managing settings across all APs is difficult.

    Interference Management – Overlapping signals cause performance issues.

    Lack of Centralized Control – No WLC means no unified policy enforcement.

    Increased Administrative Overhead – Each AP requires individual monitoring and updates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What happens to a wireless client connected to a Lightweight AP in local mode if WLC goes down?

    Without FlexConnect: Clients disconnect as APs cannot authenticate them.

    With FlexConnect: Clients continue working, as APs handle local authentication and data forwarding.
